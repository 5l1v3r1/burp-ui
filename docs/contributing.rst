Contributions are welcome. You can help in any way you want, for instance by
opening issues on the `bug tracker
<https://git.ziirish.me/ziirish/burp-ui/issues>`__, sending patches, etc.

There is also a dedicated website. Currently it only hosts a `Discourse
<http://www.discourse.org/>`__ instance where you ca discuss with each other.
No need to create another account, the one you use in the `bug tracker
<https://git.ziirish.me/ziirish/burp-ui/issues>`__ can be imported
automatically!

Feel free to use it and post your tips and remarks.

The address is: `http://burpui.ziirish.me/ <http://burpui.ziirish.me/>`__
